# Welcome to Takara

## Takara Lend, epic liquidity on Sei

Takara Lend is a native lending protocol on the Sei ecosystem based on an overcollaterization model.  Our plan is to become the leading liquidity layer. \
\
The Takara team are grant recipients of the Sei Foundation, and we couldn't be more excited to be building on such a bullish blockchain. \
\
Sei leverages a high-performance consensus mechanism enabling faster and more efficient transactions. Working with features like parallel block processing and low-latency allows Takara to provide a robust environment for borrowers and liquidity providers.

### Core Services of Takara Lend

Takara offers lending services for a range of assets including LRTs, wBTC & ETH. Users can also stake our native token $TKL to earn yields up to 50%.&#x20;

The following features sets Takara apart from basic lending services:

* **Asset Custody:** Takara has a non-custodial architecture that allows users retain complete control over their digital assets while lending.&#x20;
* **User-Friendly Experience:** We provide a simplified, user-friendly interface so that both novice and experienced users can effortlessly lend and borrow digital assets.
* **Robust Security:** Security is at the core of Takara's design philosophy. The protocol employs robust security measures to protect user funds.
* **On-Chain Governance:** Any changes or updates to the Takara protocol require on-chain governance proposals. This ensures alignment with community interests and eliminates single points of failure.&#x20;
* **RWA Integration:** Through integrations Takara facilitates lending, repayment, and liquidation processes with funds directly from USD bank accounts, thereby significantly lowering the barriers to entry from the traditional web2 space.
