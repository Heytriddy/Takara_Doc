{% hint style="success" %}
Once the transaction is confirmed, you will have exchanged the tTokens in your wallet with the asset tokens that you initially deposited into the protocol.

Every asset supported by the protocol has its own corresponding tToken. For instance, tUSDT represents the minted version of USDT token on Sei V2.

## Checking Available Liquidity

Before initiating a withdrawal, it’s essential to ensure there is enough available liquidity in the protocol. Withdrawals can only be completed if sufficient unborrowed liquidity exists. If liquidity is insufficient, the transaction may fail.

### **Compare Withdrawal Amount with Liquidity**

To prevent transaction failures, users should compare the withdrawal amount with the available liquidity in the market they wish to withdraw from. To check a market’s liquidity, navigate to either the "Lend" or "Borrow" section, select the desired asset, and review the market information provided.

### Waiting for Liquidity

If the available liquidity is insufficient to complete the withdrawal, users will need to wait until additional liquidity becomes available. Liquidity increases when lenders supply more of the desired asset or when borrowers repay their loans.
