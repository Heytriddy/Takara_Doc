# Loan Repayment

## Overview

Unlike traditional finance, loans on Takara have no fixed repayment timelines. Borrowers can maintain their loans indefinitely, provided their “Credit Remaining” balance stays above $0. If this condition is not met, the liquidation process is triggered, resulting in the borrower’s collateral being seized to repay the loan.

## Loan Structure

Loans on Takara have no fixed repayment schedule or maturity date. They remain active as long as the borrower’s “Credit Remaining” stays above the liquidation threshold.

## Accrued Interest Impact

Although there are no fixed repayment deadlines, interest will continue to accumulate over time. This accrued interest can reduce the borrower’s remaining credit, increasing the risk of liquidation. The borrowing rate is determined by the supply and demand dynamics of the underlying asset.

## How to Repay

1. Navigate to "**Dashboard**".
2. Choose the asset you would like to repay.
3. Switch to "**Repay**" using the tabs at the top of the modal.
