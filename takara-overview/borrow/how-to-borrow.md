# How to Borrow

## About

You can borrow assets using your supplied assets as collateral.

## **Prerequisites**

To borrow assets on Takara, follow these steps:

1. **Supply Assets:**

Deposit one or more supported assets into the protocol. These assets will act as collateral for taking out an over-collateralized loan. All available assets are listed in the Markets section.

2. **Enable Collateral:**

Use the collateral toggle to specify whether an asset should be designated as collateral for borrowing.

* To enable an asset as collateral, switch the collateral toggle **ON**. This signals that the asset can be used to secure a loan.
* For example, if a user supplies USDT and wants to borrow against it, they must toggle “ON” for USDT as collateral. This action authorizes Takara to use the supplied USDT as collateral for borrowing.
* If a user does not wish to borrow against an asset, they can leave the collateral toggle set to “OFF.” This ensures the asset is not used as collateral for loans.

## How to Borrow
