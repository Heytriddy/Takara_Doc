To begin using Takara, the first step is to connect a wallet.

Takara is deployed on the Sei Networks V2, which is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible. This compatibility ensures that a broad spectrum of wallets can support Takara.

Upon [wallet connection](wallet-connection.md), users will have full access to the functionalities of Takara, including lending, borrowing, and staking.
