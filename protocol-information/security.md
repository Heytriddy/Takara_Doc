## Takara Security Measures

Takara is dedicated to delivering a secure and dependable protocol for its users. To accomplish this, it has implemented a robust set of security measures aimed at minimizing risks, addressing potential vulnerabilities, and ensuring the protocol‚Äôs integrity and resilience.

The following security measures have been implemented:

1. **Security Audits**

Takara's smart contracts and systems have undergone thorough audits by one or more top-tier security firms. These audits involve an in-depth analysis of the protocol‚Äôs codebase to detect and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities, ensuring adherence to best practices. Takara contributors work closely with auditors to resolve any identified issues, enhancing the protocol‚Äôs overall security.

To further strengthen its security, Takara has partnered with [**Zellic Security**](https://www.zellic.io/), a leading blockchain security firm. This partnership enables Takara to promptly identify and address new vulnerabilities, ensuring the protocol remains secure and resilient over time.

2. **Dynamic Price Oracles**

Takara leverages multiple price oracles to ensure accurate and reliable price feeds. The system dynamically selects between [API3](https://api3.org/), [Redstone](https://www.redstone.finance/), and [Pyth](https://www.pyth.network/) for asset oracle pricing, providing seamless continuity in case any oracle becomes unavailable.

This dynamic oracle system reduces the risk of price manipulation, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the protocol and protecting user funds.

3. **Safety Module(COMING SOON)**

The Takara Safety Module provides an extra layer of protection against unexpected events, such as smart contract vulnerabilities, liquidation failures, or oracle disruptions. Integrated into Takara‚Äôs security framework, the Safety Module strengthens the protocol‚Äôs resilience and ensures greater reliability.
